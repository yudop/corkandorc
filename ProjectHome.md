A.) General Information

Sticky Note Cork&Orc is an application for creating visual notes on a cork board environment. 8 colors and 3 different note sizes are supported. The cork area is scrollable 2D, both horizontally and vertically; the environment is larger than the screen. Within the app, you may create several cork boards and swap between them as desired.

B.) Supported Screens

Sticky Note Cork&Orc is dedicated to 240x320, 320x480, 480x800 and 480x854 screens. Generally it should also work on other devices, but there is no promise for a good user experience as it is not tested or fully adapted for other resolutions than mentioned.

C.) Data Storage Information

Sticky Note Cork&Orc uses an automatical double saving technique. Notes and cork boards get saved automatically, if you leave the application/ enter the settings window and after several other occasions. The saving location is both the internal storage of the application and the SD card (/sdcard/corcandorc/corkandorc.sav), if the SD card is active. If the SD card is not readable/writable, data will only be stored within the internal storage. The advantage of storing data to the SD card is, that those files won't be affected if the application gets updated. As the data within the internal storage get unevitably lost during the uninstallation process, the second saving layer on the SD card is necessary to restore the old notes after the update. Sticky Note Cork&Orc manages this automatically. However, in order to get maximum data safety, it is best to make an additional custom backup with the 'Backup Manager'.
